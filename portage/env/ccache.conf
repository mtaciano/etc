# Portage defaults to ${PORTAGE_TMPDIR}/ccache unless CCACHE_DIR is
# set in make.conf or in /etc/portage/env (or similar).
CCACHE_DIR="/var/cache/ccache"

# This should only be needed if using a directory that Portage
# doesn't control, e.g. /var/cache/ccache.
# May be needed to workaround a bug, but has some security implications.
